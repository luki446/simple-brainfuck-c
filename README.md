# simple-brainfuck-c
Reimplementation of my brainfuck interpreter but with C instead of Rust, because why not
## Build
To build this project you simply need some C compiler for example gcc or tcc
```
gcc main.c -o simple-bf.exe
```
## Usage
To use run this command on compiled executable and bbrain fuck script ex.
```
./simple-bf.exe example.bf
```
### About Brainfuck
Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban Müller, and notable for its extreme minimalism.

The language consists of only eight simple commands and an instruction pointer. While it is fully Turing complete, it is not intended for practical use, but to challenge and amuse programmers. Brainfuck simply requires one to break commands into microscopic steps.

The language's name is a reference to the slang term brainfuck, which refers to things so complicated or unusual that they exceed the limits of one's understanding.
